## ðŸ”§ Technical Details

### Fixed Issues

#### 1. Basic Plan Problem
- **Root Cause**: Not a Basic plan specific issue - all plans require authentication
- **Solution**: Verified all plan configurations work correctly
- **Code**: Plans are properly mapped in `/src/lib/dodo-payments-config.ts`

#### 2. Invoice Download Problem  
- **Root Cause**: Using wrong API endpoint, not getting actual PDFs
- **Solution**: Updated to try multiple Dodo API endpoints
- **Code**: Enhanced `/src/app/api/billing/invoice/[paymentId]/download/route.ts`

#### 3. Buy Credits Implementation
- **Implementation**: Complete credit purchase system
- **Files**:
  - `/src/components/app/BuyCredits.tsx` - UI component
  - `/src/app/api/credits/purchase/route.ts` - API endpoint
  - `/src/app/api/payments/webhook/route.ts` - Webhook handling
  - Updated dashboard with 5th tab

### System Architecture

```
Buy Credits Flow:
1. User selects package/custom amount
2. API creates Dodo payment
3. User completes payment on Dodo
4. Webhook processes payment success
5. Credits granted to user account
6. User redirected back to dashboard
```
