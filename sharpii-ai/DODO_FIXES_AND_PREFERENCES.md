4. **Navigation**: Seamless movement between Dashboard, Editor, and Results

### 6. **Fixed Double Credit Allocation for Creator Plan**
- **Updated**: `/src/app/api/payments/webhook/route.ts`
- **Problem**: Users on the Creator Plan (monthly) were receiving double credits due to overlapping Dodo events ("payment.succeeded" and "subscription.active") and parallel credit allocation logic.
- **Solution**:
  - **Guard in `handleDirectPaymentSuccess`**: Added a guard clause to skip credit allocation for subscription payments, deferring credit allocation to subscription-specific handlers.
  - **Strengthened Idempotency in `handleSubscriptionActive`**: Implemented robust checks for existing credits using transaction ID, subscription metadata, and a 15-minute time-window heuristic for recent credit allocations with matching amounts.
  - **Strengthened Idempotency in `handleSubscriptionRenewed`**: Added similar idempotency checks to prevent duplicate credit allocations on subscription renewals.
  - **Ensured Allocation Logic Records Metadata**: Verified that credit allocation logic records payment ID and subscription metadata for accurate idempotency checks.

## 7. Payment Account Mapping and Attribution Fix (Code-focused)

- Problem
  - Some Dodo events arrived with missing/insufficient metadata, leading to payments being attributed to the wrong user or not attributed at all until a later heuristic step kicked in.
  - This occasionally raced with subscription handlers and increased the chance of mis-credit or double-credit during overlapping event bursts.

- Code Changes (high-level summary)
  - Hardened user attribution in direct payment flow with layered lookups and correlation, and separated subscription-credit allocation away from the direct-payment handler.
    - Layered attribution order inside <mcsymbol name="handleDirectPaymentSuccess" filename="route.ts" path="/Users/dheer/Documents/sharpcode/sharpii-ai/src/app/api/payments/webhook/route.ts" startline="166" type="function"></mcsymbol>:
      1) metadata.userId/plan/billingPeriod
      2) time-based correlation + plan/billingPeriod
      3) subscriptionId lookup against internal mapping service
      4) paymentId lookup against internal mapping service
      5) email fallback via users table
    - Guard to skip credit allocation for subscription payments in direct handler (so credits are only allocated in subscription.* handlers).
  - Kept payments table consistent (create/update) regardless of where credits are allocated, and always updated the user profile from payment data when available.

- Exact Code Touch Points
  - Webhook route: <mcfile name="route.ts" path="/Users/dheer/Documents/sharpcode/sharpii-ai/src/app/api/payments/webhook/route.ts"></mcfile>
    - Direct payments handler (hardened attribution + guard): <mcsymbol name="handleDirectPaymentSuccess" filename="route.ts" path="/Users/dheer/Documents/sharpcode/sharpii-ai/src/app/api/payments/webhook/route.ts" startline="166" type="function"></mcsymbol>
    - Recurring invoice success (monthly credit cycle): <mcsymbol name="handlePaymentSucceeded" filename="route.ts" path="/Users/dheer/Documents/sharpcode/sharpii-ai/src/app/api/payments/webhook/route.ts" startline="591" type="function"></mcsymbol>
    - Subscription activated (initial credits, idempotency enforced): <mcsymbol name="handleSubscriptionActive" filename="route.ts" path="/Users/dheer/Documents/sharpcode/sharpii-ai/src/app/api/payments/webhook/route.ts" startline="1030" type="function"></mcsymbol>
    - Subscription renewed (recurring credits, idempotency enforced): <mcsymbol name="handleSubscriptionRenewed" filename="route.ts" path="/Users/dheer/Documents/sharpcode/sharpii-ai/src/app/api/payments/webhook/route.ts" startline="1251" type="function"></mcsymbol>
    - Payment data -> user profile updater: <mcsymbol name="updateUserProfileFromPayment" filename="route.ts" path="/Users/dheer/Documents/sharpcode/sharpii-ai/src/app/api/payments/webhook/route.ts" startline="969" type="function"></mcsymbol>
  - Credit allocation core:
    - <mcsymbol name="CreditsService" filename="credits-service.ts" path="/Users/dheer/Documents/sharpcode/sharpii-ai/src/lib/credits-service.ts" startline="23" type="class"></mcsymbol> ‚Ä¢ <mcsymbol name="allocateSubscriptionCredits" filename="credits-service.ts" path="/Users/dheer/Documents/sharpcode/sharpii-ai/src/lib/credits-service.ts" startline="75" type="function"></mcsymbol>
    - <mcsymbol name="CreditManager" filename="credits.ts" path="/Users/dheer/Documents/sharpcode/sharpii-ai/src/lib/credits.ts" startline="5" type="class"></mcsymbol> ‚Ä¢ <mcsymbol name="grantCredits" filename="credits.ts" path="/Users/dheer/Documents/sharpcode/sharpii-ai/src/lib/credits.ts" startline="36" type="function"></mcsymbol> ‚Ä¢ <mcsymbol name="grantMonthlyCredits" filename="credits.ts" path="/Users/dheer/Documents/sharpcode/sharpii-ai/src/lib/credits.ts" startline="262" type="function"></mcsymbol>

- Why this fixes the payment account attribution
  - If metadata is missing, we still converge on the correct user via multiple fallbacks.
  - We no longer allocate subscription credits from the direct payments path, removing race conditions with subscription handlers.
  - Credits always include metadata (dodo_subscription_id, payment reference) enabling robust idempotency in future checks.


## 8. Recurrence Playbook (Payment Account + Double-Crediting)

If either issue resurfaces, re-implement by testing end-to-end across all event flows. Use this checklist to validate and re-apply the code paths.

- Preconditions
  - Test environment has Dodo webhook forwarding correctly to our POST endpoint.
  - Ensure mapping helper API is reachable for correlation lookups.

- What to Verify and Where
  1) Direct payment handler guard (prevents subscription-credit allocation):
     - Confirm the early-return/skip for subscription payments in <mcsymbol name="handleDirectPaymentSuccess" filename="route.ts" path="/Users/dheer/Documents/sharpcode/sharpii-ai/src/app/api/payments/webhook/route.ts" startline="166" type="function"></mcsymbol>.
     - Ensure payments table entries are still created/updated and user profile updated via <mcsymbol name="updateUserProfileFromPayment" filename="route.ts" path="/Users/dheer/Documents/sharpcode/sharpii-ai/src/app/api/payments/webhook/route.ts" startline="969" type="function"></mcsymbol>.
  2) Idempotency in subscription handlers (prevents double credits):
     - In <mcsymbol name="handleSubscriptionActive" filename="route.ts" path="/Users/dheer/Documents/sharpcode/sharpii-ai/src/app/api/payments/webhook/route.ts" startline="1030" type="function"></mcsymbol> and <mcsymbol name="handleSubscriptionRenewed" filename="route.ts" path="/Users/dheer/Documents/sharpcode/sharpii-ai/src/app/api/payments/webhook/route.ts" startline="1251" type="function"></mcsymbol>, verify checks:
       - transaction_id check against credits table
       - metadata contains check for { dodo_subscription_id }
       - recent-credit heuristic (same amount within 15 minutes)
  3) Credit recording includes identifying metadata:
     - In <mcsymbol name="allocateSubscriptionCredits" filename="credits-service.ts" path="/Users/dheer/Documents/sharpcode/sharpii-ai/src/lib/credits-service.ts" startline="75" type="function"></mcsymbol>, ensure metadata includes dodo_subscription_id and payment_id.
     - In <mcsymbol name="grantCredits" filename="credits.ts" path="/Users/dheer/Documents/sharpcode/sharpii-ai/src/lib/credits.ts" startline="36" type="function"></mcsymbol>, ensure transaction_id/metadata are persisted.
  4) Recurring invoicing path allocates monthly credits exactly once:
     - In <mcsymbol name="handlePaymentSucceeded" filename="route.ts" path="/Users/dheer/Documents/sharpcode/sharpii-ai/src/app/api/payments/webhook/route.ts" startline="591" type="function"></mcsymbol>, confirm pre-deduction of remaining credits and single call to monthly allocation via <mcsymbol name="grantMonthlyCredits" filename="credits.ts" path="/Users/dheer/Documents/sharpcode/sharpii-ai/src/lib/credits.ts" startline="262" type="function"></mcsymbol>.

- End-to-End Test Plan
  - Subscription activation scenario
    - Trigger subscription.active with minimal metadata.
    - Expect exactly one new credits row with correct amount and metadata (dodo_subscription_id + payment ref).
  - Recurring renewal scenario
    - Trigger recurring invoice success then subscription.renewed.
    - Expect only one monthly allocation, and any prior remaining credits are deducted exactly once.
  - Direct payment (non-subscription) scenario
    - Trigger a one-time payment without subscription_id.
    - Expect credits to be granted via direct path and user profile updated.
  - Failure scenarios
    - Simulate payment failure and ensure no credits are allocated; verify payments row status=failed is recorded.

- Quick Diff Summary to Re-apply if Needed
  - handleDirectPaymentSuccess: keep layered attribution, add/retain guard to skip subscription credits, create/update payments row, update user profile.
  - handleSubscriptionActive/Renewed: include idempotency checks (transaction_id, metadata contains dodo_subscription_id, recent-credit heuristic) before allocation.
  - allocateSubscriptionCredits/grantCredits: ensure transaction_id and dodo identifiers are stored in metadata for downstream idempotency and audit.

**New Credit Allocation Features**:
- ‚úÖ **Single Credit Allocation**: Ensures credits are allocated only once per valid event.
- ‚úÖ **Robust Idempotency Checks**: Prevents duplicate credit entries for the same transaction or subscription event.
- ‚úÖ **Clearer Event Handling**: Separates credit allocation logic for direct payments and subscriptions.
