# ðŸŽ‰ Implementation Complete - Final Status Report

## âœ… All Issues Fixed Successfully

### 1. **Localtunnel Password Issue** âœ… FIXED

- **New URL**: `https://famous-views-like.loca.lt`
- **Status**: âœ… Working without password

### 2. **Signup Redirect Flow** âœ… FIXED

  - Pricing section auto-triggers payment flow for authenticated users
- **Status**: âœ… New users now go: Plan Selection â†’ Signup â†’ Payment

### 3. **Monthly Credit System** âœ… IMPLEMENTED

- **Features**:
  - Credits expire exactly 30 days from allocation
  - Before monthly renewal: remaining credits are deducted (-Y)
  - After successful payment: new credits are allocated (+X)
  - FIFO credit consumption (oldest credits used first)
  - Full transaction history and audit trail
